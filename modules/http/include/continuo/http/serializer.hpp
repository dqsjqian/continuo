// continuo/http/serializer.hpp — turning a response into bytes.
//
// Serialisation is where a server leaks information and breaks framing, so the
// rules are enforced here rather than trusted to callers:
//
//   * A response must have exactly one framing header. `Content-Length` and
//     `Transfer-Encoding` together is the same ambiguity the parser rejects on
//     the way in, and a server that emits it is the *cause* of a smuggling
//     chain rather than a victim.
//   * Header values are validated. A value containing CR or LF would inject a
//     header — or an entire response — into the byte stream, which is how
//     "response splitting" works.
//   * 1xx, 204 and 304 carry no body by definition, so no framing header is
//     written for them regardless of what the caller set.
//
// Writing to a `Buffer` rather than straight to a socket keeps this layer
// synchronous and testable: the bytes can be asserted against a string.
