/// This option exists because the platforms disagree, and the disagreement is
/// silent. `SO_REUSEADDR` on POSIX permits rebinding a port left in TIME_WAIT;
/// the same constant on Windows lets a second process **steal** a port another
/// process is actively bound to, so two servers "successfully" listen on one
/// port and split the incoming connections between them.
///
/// Mira therefore does not expose `SO_REUSEADDR` as a portable flag. It
/// exposes the *intent*, and each backend implements it with whatever option
/// actually produces that behaviour — `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Windows,
/// plain `SO_REUSEADDR`-off on POSIX.
