// continuo/transport/endpoint.hpp — an IP address and port.
//
// `Endpoint` owns the encoded `sockaddr` bytes and hands them to the event
// loop as an opaque blob. That split is deliberate: `core` performs syscalls
// but knows nothing about address families, and this layer knows about address
// families but performs no I/O.
//
// Numeric parsing only — no DNS. Name resolution blocks, needs its own
// cancellation story, and belongs in a resolver built on the loop rather than
// hidden inside an address type where every construction might take a second.
