// continuo/core/event_loop.hpp — asynchronous I/O, timers, and coroutine
// resumption, on every supported platform.
//
// The public API is **completion-shaped**:
//
//     std::size_t n = (co_await loop.read(handle, buffer)).value();
//
// "tell me when this read has finished", not "tell me when this handle is
// readable". That choice is what makes one API work across kqueue, epoll, and
// IOCP — see `platform.hpp` for why readiness-shaped APIs cannot be ported to
// IOCP without emulating it badly.
//
// Threading contract:
//   * `post()` and `stop()` are safe from any thread.
//   * `OperationOptions::stop` may be requested from any thread; the
//     cancellation is delivered on the loop thread.
//   * everything else must be called on the thread running the loop.
//
// Resumption always happens outside the loop's internal lock, so a resumed
// coroutine may freely submit more I/O, post work, or stop the loop. It may
// not destroy or replace the loop it is being resumed by — see `~EventLoop`.

    // Every operation below accepts `OperationOptions` for cancellation and a
    // deadline. Shared rules, so that each one does not restate them:
    //
    //   * The options are evaluated **before** the first syscall. An operation
    //     whose token is already stopped reports `Errc::cancelled` without
    //     touching the handle; one whose deadline has already passed reports
    //     `Errc::timed_out`. If both apply, cancellation wins — an explicit
    //     request outranks an elapsed budget. This holds for zero-length
    //     operations too, which therefore report the reason rather than 0.
    //   * Within one `run_once`, a genuine completion is delivered before a
    //     deadline or a cancellation that landed in the same batch, and an
    //     operation resolves exactly once.
    //   * Cancellation does **not** roll back I/O that already happened.
