// Mira/core/stream.hpp — the seam between transport and protocol.
//
// This header is the reason Mira grow protocols without growing its
// core. A protocol module never names a socket type: it is written against
// `AsyncReadStream` / `AsyncWriteStream`, so the same parser runs over TCP, a
// Unix socket, a TLS session, or an in-memory pipe used by tests.
//
// The contract is intentionally thin — `read_some` / `write_some` with
// short-transfer semantics, exactly like the syscalls underneath:
//
//   * `read_some` resolves with the number of bytes read; 0 bytes means the
//     peer closed the stream, reported as `Errc::eof`.
//   * `write_some` resolves with the number of bytes accepted, which may be
//     fewer than offered. Full-write loops are the caller's business.
//
// Anything richer (read_exactly, read_until, write_all) is a free function
// composed on top, never a new requirement on implementers.

// ── streams that can be cut short ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Cancellation cannot be composed onto a stream from the outside: only the
// layer that actually waits can stop waiting. So a stream either accepts
// `OperationOptions` or it cannot honour them, and pretending otherwise would
// mean a deadline that silently does nothing.
//
// These refine the concepts above rather than replacing them. An operation
// parameter with a default keeps the one-argument call valid, so every
// `BoundedStream` is also an `AsyncStream` and nothing that was written against
// the thin contract has to change. A stream that does not accept options stays
// perfectly usable — it just cannot be handed a deadline, which is the honest
// outcome rather than a quiet one.

// WSASend), so the seam offers the vector shape and every implementer that
// can passes it straight down.
