// Mira/core/executor.hpp — where coroutines get resumed.
//
// Mira does not own a thread policy. The `Executor` concept is the single
// hook a host uses to decide *which thread* runs a resumption, which is what
// lets the library sit under a GUI framework's main loop, a per-core event
// loop, or a plain thread pool without any of them knowing about the others.
//
// The concept is one function — `post(callable)`, "run this soon, not now" —
// because that is the smallest thing every scheduler already has. Timers and
// readiness waits are separate interfaces owned by the event loop, so a host
// that only wants to control thread affinity does not have to implement them.
//
// `InlineExecutor` runs work immediately on the calling thread. It exists for
// tests and for single-threaded embedding; it is not a default, because
// silently running I/O completions inline is exactly the kind of surprise this
// seam is meant to prevent.
